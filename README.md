After the analysis, I recommend expansion in the following cities.

1. Pune - It generates the highest amount of revenue of up to 1,258,290 
2. Delhi - The population of 7.7 million persons and estimated number of coffee consumers is the highest
3. Chennai - It equally generates a very high amount of revenue and has a fair amount of total rent.
3. Jaipur - Has the highest number of unique customers which is 69. Total rent is also relatively low in this city.
